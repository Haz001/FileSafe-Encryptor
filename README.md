## FileSafe V1 Info
Using state of the art encription techniques (in 1992) we encript your files and it is really hard to get the encription key.
### How do we keep data safe?
We use your password as the encription key.
We hash that password with a reasonably safe (for home use) Hashing system called MD5.
This system was made in the 90's and is at the end of its life but is still widly used for password hashing.
MD5 has been cracked but for a home user that just wants to keep files safe from other users then this is a good solution.
### What is hashing?
It is a process of creating a string of character from data.
It is hard to work the input from the output as it can't be reversed and a computer has to come up with the input through trial and error.
### Who should use it?
Home users.
Don't use this on important top securate files like buisness and goverment documents.
### Cost?
<b>Free For <s>Now</s> Ever</b>

# Important Info!!! READ!!!
When updating make unencripted copies as updates will have a diffrent more secure encription method.
